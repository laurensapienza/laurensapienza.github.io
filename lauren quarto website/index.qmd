# Hello! My name is Lauren Sapienza

I am currently a graduate student in Case Western Reserve University's Biomedical and Health Informatics Master's Program. I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of Dayton in 2023 with a major in biology and a minor in psychology. I have worked in clinical laboratories for over a year, with experience in blood banking and cord blood processing. I am interested in public health, healthcare access, and mental healthcare.

Outside of my career and academics, I am passionate about sustainability and environmental justice; travel and cultural exchange; and LGBTQ+ rights. I have 5 cats: Luna, Sage, Belle, Finn, and Jinx. I enjoy reading, crafting, and playing video games in my free time.

Thanks for visiting my website, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:laurensapienza3901@gmail.com) if you have any questions.
