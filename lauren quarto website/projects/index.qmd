The River Stewards is the flagship program of the Rivers Institute. The three-year interdisciplinary program focused on leadership development and civic engagement is based on the model of learn, lead and serve.

As a part of the 2023 cohort of River Stewards, I worked directly with the Dakota Center, a community center in Dayton, Ohio, to create educational programming focused on sustainability and watershed education. We also helped to physically restore some of their outdoor spaces, including community gardens.
